# Silvia Yu's Prog 270 Repository

Here is where I'm putting some of my files from the Prog 270 Winter, 2016 class.

## Git Steps

```
git status
git add REAME.md
git status
git commit -m "My Commit"
git push
```

Don't ever do a git commit without the dash m (-m). It opens an editor and you won't be happy when you are in it.

## Success

I pulled my changes down into qux.

# this
- first change
- second change
- third change
- fourth change
